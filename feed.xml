The homepage will be used as a small professional webpage and the site will be used to host and archive preprints. Iâ€™m most interested in the blog component of this site. A blog will be a good opportunity to share smaller projects and ideas. These may include projects that are distant from my research or cutting-room material which may not make it to a paper. Often, these types of projects will sit indefinitely in a private GitHub repo. In addition to the sharing component, I hope these posts will force me to clean minor research code and practice writing up technical ideas.</summary></entry></feed>
