            "content": "While creating this homepage and blog, I had several goals in mind. The homepage will be used as a small professional webpage and the site will be used to host and archive preprints. I’m most interested in the blog component of this site. A blog will be a good opportunity to share smaller projects and ideas. These may include projects that are distant from my research or cutting-room material which may not make it to a paper. Often, these types of projects will sit indefinitely in a private GitHub repo. In addition to the sharing component, I hope these posts will force me to clean minor research code and practice writing up technical ideas. . I’ll revisit this post in a year to see how things went. . PS: “Grad Student Descent is All You Need” is a combination of two inside jokes in the ML field. Attention Is All You Need is one of the most influential papers in deep learning and has inspired many “X Is All You Need” offshoots. Grad student descent is a spin on gradient descent and seems to be a universal research method. .",
